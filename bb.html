                <p>Becoming Butterfly emerged from a Northwestern UX/UI Design class, offering a platform for individuals seeking like-minded companionship in their journey towards mental well-being.</p>
                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>Our goals for the app were to privde users with comprehensive tools for enhancing mental health, facilitating connections with others, and locating therapists, all within a serene, inviting, and user-friendly interface.</p>
                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>It is difficult for people to find others who think alike and are also looking to improve their mental health. Finding a space that is welcoming to everyone and promotes healthy thinking is very difficult to find.</p>

                <h1>Goals</h1> 
                <p>Our research objectives were to gain a comprehensive understaning of users' perceptions of "mental health". What does an optimal state of mental well-being look like to them? What tools and resources do they need to achieve it? We aimed to explore alternative tools beyond conventional methods such as counseling that users prefer to utilize. Additionally, we sought to identify the pain points users encounter on their mental health journey, with the intention of mitigating these challenges.</p>

                    <img src="images/BB Comp An.png">
                    <p>After conducting a thorough competitive analysis, we identified Sanvello and Moodfit as our primary market challengers. Nevertheless, our research revealed that none of these competitors offer the comprehensive suite of features that we are committed to providing to our users at no cost. Additionally, we were able to confirm which features users perceive as most valuable, ensuring our product will align with user needs and preferences.</p>
                </div>
            <h1>User Interviews</h1>
                <div class="bb-userinterviews">
                    <p>My team sought participants of all ages who are dedicated to improving their mental health and implemented a dual-survey approach to gather both quantitative and qualitative data. This strategy aimed to identify the daily challenges users faced and the support they require to navigate difficult days. Intially, we distributed a survey to 19 participants using Google Forms, sent out via text and social media platforms. Following the survey, we conducted in-depth interviews with four participants to gain deeper insights into their daily challenges and past therapy experiences.</p>
                    <img src="images/User Interviews Graphics.png">
                    <p> From these finding we know we wanted to have tools that allow users to transfer the skills they leanr in therapy and apply to daily life. We wanted them to be able to connect and build meaningful relationships with other users who are on a similar path and provide them with tools that help them work on balancing their busy lives.</p>

            <p>Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.

            We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.</p>
