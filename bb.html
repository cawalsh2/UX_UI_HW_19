                <p>Becoming Butterfly emerged from a Northwestern UX/UI Design class, offering a platform for individuals seeking like-minded companionship in their journey towards mental well-being.</p>
                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>Our goals for the app were to privde users with comprehensive tools for enhancing mental health, facilitating connections with others, and locating therapists, all within a serene, inviting, and user-friendly interface.</p>
                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>It is difficult for people to find others who think alike and are also looking to improve their mental health. Finding a space that is welcoming to everyone and promotes healthy thinking is very difficult to find.</p>

            <p>Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.

            We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it.</p>
