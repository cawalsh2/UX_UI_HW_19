                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>I focus on understanding how people feel about things, watching how they use stuff, and figuring out what they need even if they don't say it. I talk to users, ask them questions, and pay attention to how they behave to create designs that really suit them. I will use zoom, google surveys, figma and many other tools while collecting user data.

                    <h3>User Empathy</h3>
                    <p>User empathy in UI/UX design calls for a blend of active listening skills, the ability to put oneself in others' shoes, and a knack for understanding users' emotions and perspectives. Tools such as user personas, journey maps, and empathy mapping facilitate a deeper comprehension of user needs, behaviors, and motivations, fostering a more empathetic design approach.

                    <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
                    <p>I was really into using Google surveys to collect as much data as possible. I'd send out surveys to lots of different people from various backgrounds to find out what website setups they liked best. This helped me figure out the ideal website functions and layouts that appealed to a wide range of users.</p>
